# Next 2 East Website
The website for 2 East, the second floor east wing of Next House at MIT.

## What does the website look like rn 
We don't have a url yet :skull:
Right now to see what it looks like you have to clone this repository and then view it locally.
For example, run in the command line:

```
git clone https://github.com/next2e/next2e-website.git
cd next2e-website
python3 -m http.server
```

And then in your browser to go localhost:8000 or whatever number the output said in `cloning onto port {number}...`

## How can I help
