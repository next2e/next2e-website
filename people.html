          <p>I was going to write a satirical bio about why I'm a Trump supporter (lolnope), but it turns out I'm too scared someone would take it seriously. That's one thing you'll learn about me if you know me well. I like to project this persona where the highest joy I get is in doing the most clever thing in whatever situation I'm in, regardless of what other people will think of me (I mean just look at this stupid, pretentious, self-reflective bio -- this shit is supposed to be light-hearted). Ironically, in reality I'm just an asshole who wants people to think he's smart. So think I'm smart. Please?</p>

            <p>- Ben(olds) is a member of the 2E Detectives, Anime Boiz, 2brawnE, and was a member of the quitters club (until he quit), among other organizations.</p>
            <p>- Likes to pretend he’s a 2017 so much that he stayed for another year. </p>
            <p>- Ben’s allegiance was once pledged to TechX but he can now proclaim “2E before blood” without a hint of falseness.</p>
            <p>- Likes making iPhone apps, which he subsequently promises to port to Android but never does. </p>
            <p>- Enjoys startup life, puns, gaming or making games, watching movies / anime, running, music, chilling with friends, and letting the collective weirdness of 2E slowly rub off on him. </p>

            <p>I like climbing trees (there is a nice tree by the tennis courts outside next), running (the esplanade is a wonderful place), hiking (the white mountains in nh are the closest good mountains), art, chocolate, honey, barnacles, and exploring boston. I used to live in 2E, then moved to Fenway House in Boston last year, and this year I am living in New House! Feel free to visit and eat my food! </p>

            <p>Hey, I am a rising junior studying Mechanical Engineering. I am the first from my family to attend college. I love playing sports, watching the NBA and any ball sports or races. If I ever have free time or is feeling 😭, I can probably be found biking down Charles or shooting hoops in the Z. I was originally born in Taishan, China, then moved to Guang Zhou to study till 4th grade, then immigrated to NY for school until MIT. I have a brother 6 year younger than me. </p>

            <p>Once upon a time (2012), in a land far, far away (Maseeh), a young then-freshman (yours truly) lived in a red brick castle (see above). For years he thought that college had everything he could ask for. Then, everything changed when the grades attacked. Only true family could save this lost soul, and when he needed them the most, benolds invited him into 2e.</p>
            <p>Other than mixing references and being a general nerd (see: vidya games, anime, star trek, and CS jokes), I also like to confuse the unsuspecting with my history on 2e.</p>
            <p>Anyways, I like to learn a bit of everything, so if you have something fun/interesting/cool/etc to share, count me in.</p>
