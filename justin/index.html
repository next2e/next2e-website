      <h2>Elizabeth</h2>
      <p class="p4 ft1">He walked by my doorway and before introducing himself, he asked if I wanted to help him move. He then took me in a sketchy <nobr>U-Haul</nobr> to his storage unit.</p>
      <h2>Cynthia</h2>

      <h2>Eli</h2>
      <p class="p10 ft1">At some point after settling into my permanent room Freshman Year, I wanted to show my girlfriend, Malini, my new room, and so I called her and asked if she wanted to videochat. I believe this was the first time we had videochatted since I'd gotten to MIT. Kevin and I had left our door open, since people were outside in the hallway, and we wanted to be thought of as part the community, especially from the start. People had been walking in and out of the room, and I'd introduced each one to Malini when they came in. I had seen Justin around beforehand, and perhaps we'd introduced ourselves to each other as well, but I hadn't had an extended encounter with him yet (or perhaps I had but it simply wasn't as memorable as this). In the middle of me videochatting with Malini, all of a sudden, Justin walks into our room. Kevin and I say "hi," and Justin notices I'm videochatting with someone. Filled with kinetic energy, Justin comes over to my desk where I'm sitting, and asks Malini and I if he can show us his boxers. I think I made out a startled "Wait, what?" before he started pulling down his pants. He revealed that his blue boxers had "MIT" written in red block letters all over them. He was very proud of this <nobr>--</nobr> I laughed and tried to push him away, but he needed me to acknowledge how cool it was that he was wearing boxers with "MIT" written on them. I finally did, begrudgingly, and I managed to corral him out of the room. Malini was hysterical as I sat back down at my desk, and I said, "Well, now you've met Justin, too."</p>
 
      <h2>Ben</h2>
      <p class="p10 ft2">I don’t actually remember the single first moment when I met Justin. There was a time early on when I was walking around deep 2E with Ashling and started talking to him, and he just dropped his pants and walked away in his boxers leaving us feeling uncomfortable. There was another time when a few of us were sitting on a couch in the lounge and he lay down over the back of the couch and started sliding down on top of us. There was lots of bodily contact and I wasn’t really sure who he was.</p>
      <p class="p11 ft2">After that I would mostly just cautiously observe Justin from a safe distance when he would hang out across the hall in Sam’s room with Sothira.</p>
      <p class="p12 ft1">Then one day I remember having my door open, and hearing Justin singing “Say Something” from down the hall. And I was stunned. “Wow,” I thought, “he’s probably the best vocalist I’ve ever met.“ Time passed and I slowly got to know Justin better. And I got weirder. Now, I'm still often alarmed by his antics, but I also encourage and enable him. What a journey. We still haven’t watched Attack on Titan, though.</p>
      <h2>Brenda</h2>
      <p class="p14 ft2">I think like the day we all moved into permanent rooms, Sothira, Lisa, and I needed help rearranging 275 so Los, Manuel, and Justin came to help us. I don't remember exactly what happened, but I do remember the chaotic experience left me wondering what weirdos I chose to live around. And I thought that Manuel and Justin were roommates.</p>
      <h2>Sothira</h2>
      <p class="p16 ft1">He helped me move and I threatened to kill him.</p>
      <h2>Hannah</h2>
      <p class="p17 ft2">Obviously, since I am a freshman, I do not know Justin all that well. However, when I first met him, he introduced himself and was very polite. Then, I saw his true colours when he danced to Ride by SoMo VERY suggestively. I am still scarred to this day.</p>
      <h2>Claire</h2>
      <p class="p4 ft2">Right after my parents and I arrived at Next House for the first time last fall, a guy named Will came over to the open door of room 239 and started talking about how he used to live there. Then another guy (Justin) came up behind him and introduced himself to my parents and I. I was mostly confused why these people were so chatty.</p>
      <h2>Erin</h2>
      <p class="p18 ft1">At first Justin was just some confusing person whose humor I couldn't understand and who made me slightly nervous. But that changed when I was sitting in my room one Saturday night during freshman fall, feeling rather forlorn and lonely as I often did during those early days, and Justin barged in and sat on Becca's bed. He asked me what I was doing and I shrugged and then he started playing guitar. I really appreciated that he took the time to talk to me and brighten up my room with <nobr>music--</nobr> I felt better after that. Even after that happened, I didn't REALLY get to know Justin until IAP, when I hung out sometimes in his room coding for the intro python class (do you remember when we sat on your bed and turned on intense music from "The Social Network" to help us get in the zone?, I think Sothira and Manuel were there too...) And of course then we formed "Love Group" and started pouring out our souls to each other. Or rather, Justin pestered me until I poured out my soul to him :P. Since then we've bonded through brushing each other's teeth, giving each other piggy back rides, me folding his clothes (why the heck did I do that), watching miyazaki films, listening to relient K and mae, that time I fed him the bubbles from my bubble tea, jamming, and everything else. One time I was having a really crappy week and Justin found me crying in my room and he physically dragged me out of there and down the hallway and then talked to me and made me feel better. He has always been a loyal friend and a good person to talk to ^____^ &lt;3</p>
      <h2>Shavina</h2>
      <p class="p20 ft1">When I was a newly <nobr>checked-in</nobr> freshman, Andrew and Justin helped me unbunk my bed and adjust the frame. This was when I was temped in 239 with Claire and Elizabeth, and we soon moved to 275 and later to 250, never to return again. So, in an indirect way, Justin really helped me out in bed, if only for a brief time. I will never forget the way he handled that mattress.</p>
      <h2>Emmanuel</h2>
      <p>There isn't any single experience that sticks out in my mind as defining our relationship. Instead, it took multiple experiences, and a fair bit of time, for me to understand you. I remember your bizarre antics, which occasionally meant contorting your face in creepy expressions, or making interesting sounds (I enjoyed them, usually), or finding you in Weilian's bed when I returned to my room. I remember talking to you about physics and math, and feeling a mixture of intimidation at your physics skillz and suspicious about your cockiness (later confirmed that the latter was a misguided guess). I remember the late night jam sessions, of which I didn't always take part but used to note how multi- talented you were. Maybe in a way, it's nice that there wasn't a defining early impression of you; it means that you are a deep enough individual that it took a lot of studying for me to understand your often crude (but addictive) humor, your sudden, pompous outbursts, your weird manner of making friends. Or maybe it means you just didn't want to be my friend and therefore didn't give me a strong first impression. Or maybe I'm aged as heck and just can't remember anymore. Whatever the reason, it made this (s)peach really hard to write. Anyway, you are full of lots of nonsense and full of even more caring for your friends, and I love you and having you as a friend. Do you remember how we met? o.o</p>
      <h2>Monica</h2>
      <p>Justin, This isn't really how I met you, because when I first met you, Will and Andrew were like "oh that's justin, he comes into room and knocks things over and farts and leaves" so I wanted to shared this story too. I remember one time when I was a freshman, I was lying on the bean bag and you plopped down next to me and you said something like, "Monica, do you respect meeeee???" And I was like, "what." And you continued on about how when you were a freshman, you thought the juniors were so cool and super smart and totally had their lives together and you have great reverence for them but you didn't feel that way to me and the other 2019s. Justin, I don't know why you thought that because why wouldn't we think you're awesome? Yeah, you're weird and you leave porn in the main lounge and you spill large sweet teas on yourself, but we love you. Tbh, you're always one of the first people I mention when talking about people who are crazy good at everything. So Justin, cut yourself some slack. Thank you for being my friend even though you make weird noises with Eman in my bed. You are super cool and really talented and crazy smart, so just be Justin. That is more than enough. Happy birthday!!!!</p>
      <h2>Manuel</h2>
