          I go by many names, but most people call me Bennett or Brobi. I basically live in the lounge, day and night.
          I am a founding member of the 2e sentinels, 2e trolls, and Strong Man Zach & Moving Co. I'm also involved in
          furniture boiz, P I Z Z A B O I Z and 2partE. I'm in room 251 with Andrew and Harry, the greatest roommates
          ever (why do you think we're still living together as seniors?).

          When not sleeping in room 251, I'm probably in the lounge yelling about helldivers, debating Michael about
          something obscure or making bad puns to make people laugh.

          - Ben(olds) is a member of the 2E Detectives, Anime Boiz, 2brawnE, and was a member of the quitters club
          (until he quit), among other organizations.

          - Likes to pretend he’s a 2017 so much that he stayed for another year.

          - Ben’s allegiance was once pledged to TechX but he can now proclaim “2E before blood” without a hint of
          falseness.

          - Likes making iPhone apps, which he subsequently promises to port to Android but never does.

          - Enjoys startup life, puns, gaming or making games, watching movies / anime, running, music, chilling with
          friends, and letting the collective weirdness of 2E slowly rub off on him.

      I like climbing trees (there is a nice tree by the tennis courts outside next), running (the esplanade is a
      wonderful place), hiking (the white mountains in nh are the closest good mountains), art, chocolate, honey,
      barnacles, and exploring boston. I used to live in 2E, then moved to Fenway House in Boston last year, and this
      year I am living in New House! Feel free to visit and eat my food!

      Once upon a time (2012), in a land far, far away (Maseeh), a young then-freshman (yours truly) lived in a red
      brick castle (see above). For years he thought that college had everything he could ask for. Then, everything
      changed when the grades attacked. Only true family could save this lost soul, and when he needed them the most,
      benolds invited him into 2e.

      Other than mixing references and being a general nerd (see: vidya games, anime, star trek, and CS jokes), I also
      like to confuse the unsuspecting with my history on 2e.

      Anyways, I like to learn a bit of everything, so if you have something fun/interesting/cool/etc to share, count
      me in.

      Hey, I am a rising junior studying Mechanical Engineering. I am the first from my family to attend college. I
      love playing sports, watching the NBA and any ball sports or races. If I ever have free time or is feeling 😭, I
      can probably be found biking down Charles or shooting hoops in the Z. I was originally born in Taishan, China,
      then moved to Guang Zhou to study till 4th grade, then immigrated to NY for school until MIT. I have a brother 6
      year younger than me.
